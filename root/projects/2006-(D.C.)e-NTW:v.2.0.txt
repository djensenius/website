(D./C.)e-NTW:v.2.0
This is the third work in a series of pieces to translate live e-mail traffic into sound, expressing in music something that is not normally heard but important to most peoples lives. Sounds are generated by the distance from the server a message is coming from. Additional sounds are generated by people checking their e-mail with the distance and country they are checking from determining the different aspects of the sounds. 

This piece is to be presented in the Olin Library Lobby at Wesleyan University in May 2006 and uses data from Wesleyan's own email servers to create the sonic environment.
