Satellites Over...
A sound installation in eight channels. Listeners are able to hear a sonic representation of satellites currently over them.

Each group of satellites (Weather, Military, etc) are given unique sonic identities. The eight channels provide an experience to the listener that allows them to approximate the location of the satellite. 

This installation can be made site specific to anywhere in the world.200
