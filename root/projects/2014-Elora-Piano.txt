Elora Piano
As a building moves, creaks and groans, its sounds are transformed into a score continuously played by a grand piano. The Elora Piano, a sound installation by David Jensenius, lets all those who wander into the Elora Centre for the Arts experience the building’s own composition.

During his residency at ECFTA Jensenius explored the building (formerly the Elora Public School) and the various groups, organizations, artists, children and adults that occupy the physical, intellectual and energetic space of Elora Centre for the Arts. His residency set the stage for Jensenius’ exhibition, wherein the artist will wire the building for activity and sound which in turn will be transformed and played through instruments stationed in the gallery as an ongoing, reactionary, musical composition.
