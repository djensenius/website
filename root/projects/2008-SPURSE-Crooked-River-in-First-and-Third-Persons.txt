Crooked River in First and Third Persons
with spurse
A 48-hour way-finding via sound experiment that re-engages the multiple legacies of the Cuyahoga River - its industrial fires, marine life losses, engineers ambitions, immigrant dreams, serpentine navigations - with its contemporary forms of agency.
The river's complex intertwined realities as an industrial, cultural and natural waterway is re-inscribed as a sonic way-finding system through the city grid of downtown Cleveland. When installed in Cleveland participants would navigate the streets of downtown Cleveland with FM radios, moving from location to location.
