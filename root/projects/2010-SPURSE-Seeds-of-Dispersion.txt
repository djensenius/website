Seeds of Dispersion
with spurse
Spurse's "Engines of Dispersal: Seeding the Premises" (2010) begins with the now globally ubiqutious apple seed. Each apple seed holds within itself a unique and individual possibility of forming a new apple species. It is a pure difference engine, as each seed?s genetic material is a full variation from its source tree. To maintain the continuity of a variety, the apple tree is held in a static relationship with the farmer via grafting and cloning. We entangle with these cross species alliances every time we eat an apple. To allow a seed to propagate is to invite emergent farmers, both human and non-human, to participate in the experimentation of that seed?s potential fruiting. This project will take the form of mundane everyday apple seed distribution systems. Bars of soap, building mortar and plaster, earth to add to puddles. These materials are for distribution from the gallery. With the possibility of germination, we are entangled into a broad future of relations- ecological diversity, management practices, genetic variation, stewardship, habitat recomposition and economic diversity.
