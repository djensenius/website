HAT Engine
HATengine is a tool for designing and building augmented reality sound games, sound walks, or locative sound installations.

Players put on headphones and walk to explore the sonic landscape youâ€™ve created. Games can be changed on the fly, with updates being automatically downloaded to users in real time. No need for annoying app updates.

HATengine will use almost any sound file. Whether it's a WAV, AIFF, or MP3, we have you covered. You can even use Pd files.

Try HATFinder, our demo game built for UCLA. Available for Android and iOS.
