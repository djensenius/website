This is the first work in a series of pieces to translate live e-mail traffic into music, expressing in music something that is not normally heard but important to most people's lives. The background sound is controlled by e-mail that is detected as junk mail by the server. Foreground sounds are generated by the distance from the server a message is coming from. Additional sounds are generated by people checking their e-mail with the distance and country they are checking from determining the different aspects of the sounds. The Zelnick Pavilion was chosen as the installation space because it's a building that only holds people temporarily, much like a server does with e-mail.
