2016 - Telephone Booth

A phone booth with older style rotary pay phone is placed in a surprising location. The instructions plate reads:

FREE CALLS TODAY
Dial 1 to leave a message
Dial 2 to retrieve a message

When someone dialâ€™s 1 to leave a message they are prompted with a provocative question. When dialling 2, a random answer is presented without context of the original question creating an emergent dialogue.

Presented for CAFKA 2016.
